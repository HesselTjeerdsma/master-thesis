  - ✅ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.50 because the LLM did not adhere to the prompt by including unnecessary repetition, a header, and multiple sentences instead of a single clear statement. These factors prevented a higher score, as they indicate a lack of clarity and conciseness in following the instructions., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction involves an unusual merchant and category for this customer, occurring at an atypical time (2:36 AM) with no prior history in this category, and the location is significantly distant from the previous transaction, raising suspicion.  
CONCLUSION: FRAUD
  - expected output: None
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: None

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.3333333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.33 because the LLM partially adhered to the prompt by analyzing the transaction but failed to present a cohesive analysis in a single statement and exceeded the word limit. Additionally, it included an analysis header and repeated part of the prompt, which detracted from alignment., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction matches the typical amount, timing, category, and active hours for this customer, and while the merchant is new, the distance traveled in 12 minutes (69.0 miles) is highly improbable for their age and profile.  
CONCLUSION: FRAUD
  - expected output: None
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: None

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.50 because the LLM provided a conclusion but did not seamlessly integrate the analysis with the prompt instruction, leading to a mixed response structure. The presence of a detailed description before the conclusion and the split format of the analysis detracted from full alignment with the prompt requirements., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction involves an unusual merchant and category with no prior history, is distant from the last transaction (82.5 miles apart within 44 minutes), which is inconsistent with typical travel patterns for a 98-year-old, raising multiple red flags.  
CONCLUSION: FRAUD
  - expected output: None
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: None

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.50 because the LLM fails to present a clear, concise conclusion as requested, instead providing multiple statements that dilute the analysis. The restatement of the prompt instruction indicates a lack of alignment with the directive to analyze and conclude succinctly. While some aspects of the output were relevant, the overall clarity and structure did not meet the expectations set by the prompt., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction aligns with the customer’s usual purchase category, timing, and amount, and while the location is new, the short travel distance in a reasonable time suggests no suspicious behavior.  
CONCLUSION: GENUINE
  - expected output: None
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: None

======================================================================

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.50 because the LLM partially followed the prompt by providing an analysis and a conclusion, but it did not present a single clear statement and included unnecessary introductory text that deviated from the prompt's instructions., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction aligns with the customer's typical purchase category, amount, and active hours, and the short time gap between locations is plausible considering possible transportation despite the distance.  
CONCLUSION: GENUINE
  - expected output: None
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: None

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.67 because the LLM did not fully adhere to the prompt instruction to present a clear, single statement for the analysis. While it repeated part of the prompt, the lack of clarity in the analysis contributed to the lower score., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction matches the customer's typical category, amount, timing, and active hours; the distance traveled is plausible within 4.1 hours.  
CONCLUSION: GENUINE  
  - expected output: None
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: None

======================================================================

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.00 because the LLM failed to adhere to multiple prompt instructions, including the requirement for a clear analysis statement and proper formatting of the conclusion. The presence of repeated prompt language and lack of step-by-step reasoning further contributed to the low score., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction involves an unusual merchant and category for this customer, occurring 73.5 miles from their last known location within 4.5 hours, which is unlikely given the customer's age and typical patterns.  
CONCLUSION: FRAUD
  - expected output: None
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: None

======================================================================

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.00 because the LLM did not adhere to the prompt's request for a clear and structured analysis leading directly to a conclusion. It included unnecessary introductory statements, failed to present a step-by-step thought process, and provided a conclusion with added context that was not permitted. These deviations significantly hindered alignment with the prompt instructions., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction involves an unusual merchant and purchase category for the customer, occurred after a significant distance traveled in only 2.5 hours, and deviates from typical spending patterns despite being within active hours.  
CONCLUSION: FRAUD
  - expected output: None
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: None
