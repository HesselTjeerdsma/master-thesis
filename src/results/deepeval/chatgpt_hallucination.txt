Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Hallucination (score: 0.3333333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.33 because there is a strong alignment with the context regarding the unusual transaction and customer profile, but a minor contradiction exists about the distance from the previous location, leading to a moderate hallucination score., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction involves a new merchant, unusual category, and no purchase history for this type, combined with a substantial distance from the previous location, which is suspicious given the customer's age and typical patterns.  
CONCLUSION: FRAUD  
  - expected output: None

  - ✅ Hallucination (score: 0.3333333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.33 because while the actual output aligns with the context regarding the customer's typical purchase behavior and profile, it fails to address a specific detail regarding the distance of 59.5 miles, leading to a minor contradiction., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction aligns with the customer’s typical category and timing, the amount is reasonable, and while the merchant is new, the location is plausible given recent travel.

  - ✅ Hallucination (score: 0.3333333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.33 because, while there are several factual alignments with the context regarding the customer's typical purchasing behavior, the mention of a location discrepancy introduces a notable inconsistency that contributes to the hallucination score., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction aligns with the customer's typical purchase category, timing, and amount, and though the merchant is new, the location discrepancy is plausible given reasonable travel time within 4.5 hours.

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction involves a new merchant and an unusual purchase category for this customer, but the small amount, typical active hours, and short distance from the previous transaction do not strongly suggest fraud.

  - ❌ Hallucination (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 1.00 because there are multiple contradictions between the actual output and the context, including improbable distance claims and misalignment with the customer's profile and shopping habits, indicating a significant lack of factual accuracy., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction matches the typical amount, timing, category, and active hours for this customer, and while the merchant is new, the distance traveled in 12 minutes (69.0 miles) is highly improbable for their age and profile.
