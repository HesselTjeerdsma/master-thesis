Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.50 because the LLM did not adhere to the instruction to avoid reiterating the prompt and included an unnecessary analysis header, which detracted from the clarity of the conclusion. While it did provide a conclusion of fraud, the multiple points made the response less direct, preventing a higher score., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: While the small purchase amount at a food establishment is reasonable, the significant travel distance from the previous transaction (99 miles) within 16 hours raises concerns for a 97-year-old individual, and this completely new merchant category deviation from their established spending patterns suggests potential unauthorized card use.
CONCLUSION: FRAUD
  - expected output: None
  - context: None

======================================================================

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.50 because the LLM partially followed the prompt by using the word 'analyze' and providing an introductory statement, but it failed to present a complete analysis in a single clear statement. The presence of multiple points detracts from clarity, preventing a higher score., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: While the merchant is new, the transaction amount, category, and timing align with the customer's normal patterns, though the travel distance of 108.8 miles in 14 hours raises moderate concern for a 94-year-old customer's typical mobility radius.
CONCLUSION: FRAUD
  - expected output: None

  - retrieval context: None

======================================================================

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.00 because the LLM failed to follow multiple prompt instructions, such as not repeating instructions, skipping text analysis headers, and not presenting the analysis in a clear, concise format. The output exceeded the word limit and did not adhere to the required structure for the conclusion. These significant unalignments resulted in a score of 0, as the instructions were not met at all., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The small transaction amount at a health/fitness merchant appears unusual for a 94-year-old customer, and while the timing is within normal hours, the significant distance from the previous transaction (41.8 miles) combined with the customer's advanced age raises concerns about mobility patterns, plus the merchant and category being completely new deviates substantially from their established shopping habits across five other regular merchants.
CONCLUSION: FRAUD
  - expected output: None

  - retrieval context: None

======================================================================

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.00 because the LLM failed to follow multiple prompt instructions, including repeating the analysis instruction, providing an introductory statement, and producing lengthy responses instead of a concise analysis. The conclusion aligns with the instruction, but the overall output did not meet the expected format, resulting in a complete lack of alignment., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: While the customer's age of 95 is notable for an exercise physiologist, the transaction itself shows consistent patterns with their normal behavior - it's within their typical spending categories (health_fitness), occurs during normal hours, has a reasonable amount for the category, and while the merchant is new, the type of purchase aligns with both their profession and established shopping habits.
CONCLUSION: GENUINE

======================================================================

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.00 because the LLM failed to follow the prompt instructions by not providing a clear, structured analysis followed by a simple conclusion. It repeated parts of the prompt, included multiple analysis points instead of a single statement, and did not adhere to the required format. This lack of clarity and structure led to a total misalignment with the prompt's expectations., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The small purchase amount of $9.88 appears unusually low for a travel merchant, while the customer's advanced age of 94, employment status, significant distance from previous transaction, and complete lack of prior travel purchases raises multiple red flags about the legitimacy of this transaction, particularly given their established shopping patterns at local merchants.

======================================================================

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.00 because the LLM failed to adhere to multiple prompt instructions, including not repeating the prompt, not providing a clear and concise analysis, and not following the specified format for the conclusion. These significant unalignments contribute to the score being so low. However, the conclusion of 'FRAUD' indicates that the LLM did understand the ultimate goal of the task, which is why it is not completely devoid of alignment., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: Given the customer's age of 94 and occupation, the travel distance of 68.8 miles in under 2 hours raises significant concerns, while the merchant and transaction amount align with their normal spending patterns but the rapid long-distance movement is physically improbable for this demographic.
CONCLUSION: FRAUD
  - expected output: None
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: None

======================================================================

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Prompt Alignment (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4o-mini, reason: The score is 0.50 because the LLM failed to follow prompt instructions by restating elements of the prompt, including an unnecessary analysis header, and not providing a concise conclusion. These factors contributed to a lower score, while the presence of a clear conclusion indicates some adherence to the prompt., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Analyze the transcation and based on that analysis conclude if it is fraud or genuine.
  - actual output: The transaction raises multiple red flags: the customer's advanced age combined with late-night shopping activity, an unusually rapid 61-mile distance covered between transactions for a 94-year-old within less than an hour, and timing at 3 AM which is questionable for elderly customers, strongly suggesting this card is being used by someone other than its legitimate owner.
