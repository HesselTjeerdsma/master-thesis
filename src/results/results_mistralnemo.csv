It's possible that they're starting to engage more actively in personal fitness activities.

**Analysis:** This transaction deviates significantly from the customer's typical spending patterns and history. They have never made a purchase in this category, especially with such an unusual merchant name. The timing of their last transaction is also relevant here; it occurred less than two hours ago and was approximately 42.5 miles away. These details indicate that they would not typically travel to this new location or engage in such a large transaction for a completely new purchase category.

**Conclusion:** FRAUD",{'fraud': False}

Transaction Analysis:

The transaction does not fit with this customer's typical purchasing habits. They usually engage in gas_transport, grocery_pos, shopping_pos, kids_pets, and health_fitness categories. This transaction falls into the food_dining category, which is unusual for them.

The merchant, Will Ltd, appears to be new to this customer, as there are no previous transactions with this particular merchant. Furthermore, the transaction amount ($2.76) seems unusually low considering that this customer typically spends larger amounts on shopping_pos and grocery_pos categories.

Considering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that this transaction may warrant further scrutiny for potential fraud due to its unusual nature in terms of both purchasing category and the relatively low transaction amount for this",{'fraud': False}

**Analysis:**
The customer's usual shopping activities are within the gas_transport, shopping_pos, personal_care, home, and grocery_pos categories. This transaction falls outside of these typical spending habits.

Furthermore, this merchant is new to this customer, and the category of purchase is unusual for them. The transaction amount is slightly lower than their average transaction size over the past year (which is approximately $109.68). However, considering that this is a new merchant and an uncommon purchase category for the customer, the amount could still be suspicious.

The transaction occurred within their typical active hours, suggesting that they were likely awake at the time of the purchase. There is no transaction history for this category, which makes it difficult to determine",{'fraud': False}
